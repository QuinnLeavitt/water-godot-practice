# Water Godot Practice
This project is to explore water shaders within godot.

So far I have created
- A basic sine wave shader that takes wave parameters and adds them together. I created this with the help of code from [Chrisknyfe's boujie_water_shader](https://github.com/Chrisknyfe/boujie_water_shader) that I modified to use sine waves instead of gerstner waves.
- A water shader that utilizes noise to create waves and changes color when it comes into contact with a surface.
- A basic caustic shader that uses noise to create a scrolling texture over an underwater material.
